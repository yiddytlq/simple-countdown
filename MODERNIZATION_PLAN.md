# Project Modernization & Code Quality Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive modernization plan for the simple-countdown project (Issue #43).

## Current State Analysis

The project currently has significant code quality issues that prevent successful builds:
- **46 linting issues** (40 errors, 6 warnings) blocking compilation
- JSX code in `.js` files instead of `.jsx` extensions
- Missing prop validation across React components
- Inconsistent code formatting and style violations
- Mixed package management with both npm and yarn configurations

## Epic Scope

This epic encompasses four major modernization initiatives:

### Phase 1: Code Quality & Standards
- Fix ESLint configuration
- Resolve all linting errors and warnings
- Standardize file extensions (.js to .jsx for JSX components)
- Implement consistent code formatting
- Add proper prop validation to React components

### Phase 2: Package Management Migration
- Complete transition from Yarn to npm
- Remove yarn.lock and update package-lock.json
- Standardize dependency management scripts
- Ensure consistent development environment setup

### Phase 3: Styling Modernization
- Migrate existing CSS to Tailwind CSS v4
- Implement utility-first approach
- Maintain mobile and desktop responsiveness
- Remove legacy CSS files

### Phase 4: TypeScript Migration
- Convert JavaScript codebase to TypeScript
- Add type definitions for improved type safety
- Configure TypeScript build pipeline
- Enhance developer experience with better IDE support

## Implementation Strategy

Each phase will be implemented incrementally with:
- Independent testing and validation
- Maintaining functionality throughout the process
- Clear rollback procedures if issues arise
- Regular progress updates and reviews

This systematic approach ensures the project modernization is completed safely while maintaining the existing functionality and deployment workflow.
